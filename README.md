# Simple interface

The editor has basic functionality and an interface similar to most popular graphic editors for more convenient use.
You can use drag and drop to open a file. The usual txt file format is used to load and save data, which ensures full compatibility with other text editors.

# Adapting bitmaps

If you open a bitmap in the editor, it will be displayed on the background of the canvas and can be used as a template or example to redraw the image into text symbols.

# Image to text conversion

You can convert a bitmap image to text format by specifying the size and symbols palette, from the symbol for the darkest color to the symbol for the lightest color.
Thus, you have complete control over the conversion process to get the most suitable result.

# Customizable symbol palette

Using the built-in character table, you can get all the available characters of a font in the selected range and use them to create your own character palette.
You can specify a character to draw without using the palette, but using the keyboard, including using keyboard shortcuts for special characters.
